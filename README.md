Bivariate Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Model Estimation  

This package is based on a draft paper ``A Bivariate Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Model For Identifying Underlying Dependence" (Hunyong Cho \& Di Wu 2019+) (will be published via arXiv).  

This is not an official package yet, and will be developed as a formal package.  

This program will be equipped with C++ and will have significantly enhanced speed. (Chuwen Liu)
